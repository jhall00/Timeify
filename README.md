# Timeify
A Spotify timed playlist generator 

In order to log into your Spotify account, due to the nature of the Spotify API, your account must first be manually added to the list of authorized users by one of our team members. Please let us know if there is another Spotify acocunt you would like to test this with other than the grader's,  Ali Haider, already authorized account.

With our program you can generate a new playlist that is a certain length by choosing the source from which to pull songs into that playlist. You will then be shown 2 options that were generated with different total lengths. The one you choose from that screen will be added to your Spotify account and you will be brought to the player page. This page has a countdown of the length of the timer along with the music playing.
You can also load in a playlist that you have on your account. The idea here is that we want you to be able to use a playlist you've created with us before at a later date. You can search for a playlist which you own.
